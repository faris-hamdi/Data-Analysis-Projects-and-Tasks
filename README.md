# Exploratory Data Analysis for Superstore Dataset

## Overview

This project involves performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a Superstore dataset to uncover meaningful insights and patterns. The analysis includes data cleaning, preparation, visualization, and statistical analysis. The notebook is structured to guide you through each step of the analysis with detailed explanations and visualizations.

## Introduction

The Superstore dataset contains information about sales, profit, and other business metrics across various regions, categories, and time periods. The goal of this analysis is to understand the key factors influencing sales and profit, identify trends, and provide actionable insights for business decision-making.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation

In this section, we handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers to ensure the dataset is clean and ready for analysis. Proper data cleaning is essential to avoid skewed or misleading results.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Univariate Analysis

We explore individual variables to understand their distribution and identify any notable patterns. This includes visualizing the distribution of sales, profit, and other key metrics.

### Bivariate Analysis

We analyze the relationships between pairs of variables to uncover any correlations or interactions. For example, we examine how sales vary across different regions and categories.

### Category-wise Analysis

This section delves into the performance of different product categories and sub-categories. We use visualizations to compare sales and profit across categories to identify top-performing and underperforming segments.

## Feature Engineering

We create new features from existing data to provide additional insights. For example, we extract the month from the order date to analyze seasonal trends in sales.

## Statistical Analysis

We perform statistical tests to validate hypotheses and trends observed in the data. For instance, we use t-tests to compare sales between different categories and determine if the differences are statistically significant.

## Conclusions

The analysis concludes with key findings and insights derived from the data. We summarize the main trends, highlight important patterns, and provide recommendations for business strategy based on the analysis.
